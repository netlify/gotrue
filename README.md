# GoTrue - User management for APIs

GoTrue is a small open-source API written in golang, that can act as a self-standing
API service for handling user registration and authentication for JAM projects.

It's based on OAuth2 and JWT and will handle user signup, authentication and custom
user data.

## Endpoints

GoTrue exposes the following endpoints:

* **POST /signup**

  Register a new user with an email and password.

  ```json
  {
    "email": "email@example.com",
    "password": "secret"
  }
  ```

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "id":1,
    "email":"email@example.com",
    "confirmation_sent_at": "2016-05-15T20:49:40.882805774-07:00",
    "created_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00",
    "updated_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00"
  }
  ```

* **POST /verify**

  Verify a registration or a password recovery. Type can be `signup` or `recover`
  and the `token` is a token returned from either `/signup` or `/recover`.

  ```json
  {
    "type": "signup",
    "token": "confirmation-code-delivered-in-email"
  }
  ```

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "jwt-token-representing-the-user",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "a-refresh-token"
  }
  ```

* **POST /recover**

  Password recovery. Will deliver a password recovery mail to the user based on
  email address.

  ```json
  {
    "email": "email@example.com"
  }
  ```

  Returns:

  ```json
  {}
  ```

* **POST /token**

  This is an OAuth2 endpoint that currently implements
  the password and refresh_token grant types

  ```
  grant_type=password&username=email@example.com&password=secret
  ```

  or

  ```
  grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=my-refresh-token
  ```

  Once you have an access token, you can access the methods requiring authentication
  by settings the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE` header.

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "jwt-token-representing-the-user",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "a-refresh-token"
  }
  ```

* **GET /user**

  Get the JSON object for the logged in user (requires authentication)

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "id":1,
    "email":"email@example.com",
    "confirmation_sent_at": "2016-05-15T20:49:40.882805774-07:00",
    "created_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00",
    "updated_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00"
  }
  ```

* **PUT /user**

  Update a user (Requires authentication). Apart from changing email/password, this
  method can be used to set custom user data.

  ```json
  {
    "email": "new-email@example.com",
    "password": "new-password",
    "data": {
      "key": "value",
      "number": 10,
      "admin": false
    }
  }
  ```

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "id":1,
    "email":"email@example.com",
    "confirmation_sent_at": "2016-05-15T20:49:40.882805774-07:00",
    "created_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00",
    "updated_at": "2016-05-15T19:53:12.368652374-07:00"
  }
  ```

* **POST /logout**

  Logout a user (Requires authentication).

  This will revoke all refresh tokens for the user. Remember that the JWT tokens
  will still be valid for stateless auth until they expires.


## TODO

* Schema for custom user data in config file
* Better logging
* Email validation on email updates
